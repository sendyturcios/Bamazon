# Welcome to Bamazon! 

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront built with JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js


Consumers are able to view current items for purchase, identification number, quantity in inventory, and item price. Consumers may also choose an item for purchase by answering a few questions such as 'What product would you like to buy?' and 'What quantity would you like to purchase?'. If Bamazon doesn't have sufficient inventory to complete your transaction, you will receive a message indicating the item is out of stock.
